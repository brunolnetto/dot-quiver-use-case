# A structure, many possibilities

Hi, this is an app, but you can interpret it as a service. Its main funcionality is to provide a graph structure for application-suitable scenarios. It was bootstraped from this project: https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms .

## Preamble

For a beginner, a graph is a bunch of dots connected by either undirected lines or directed arrows. Take a look at the following URL: https://adrianmejia.com/data-structures-for-beginners-graphs-time-complexity-tutorial/


## How to run

You may utilize some cloud service to host the app, like AWS, Azure or GCloud, but in this case you might run locally.
You must follow the instructions below

1) Clone the repository typing on terminal `git clone git@github.com:brunolnetto/node-link.git`;
3) Run the command `npm install` to install local dependencies;
3) Run the command `npm start` to run the server locally;
4) Open a browser;
5) Type `localhost:8080` on the URL field;
